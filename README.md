RotoShapesToTrackers
======================
This Nuke python script will bake the actual rotoshapes' points positions to trackers on the requested framerange, including transforms on the parent Layers

Latest update create trackers inside a single node, using the new Nuke v7 tracker node.

TIP: to speed up tracker creation, create a copy of the shape on a new node and delete unwanted (trackers) points from it.
